Publish (immediately) allows you to set a future or past date and time, so you can schedule a post to be published in the future or backdate a post. The Password protected option allows you to set an arbitrary password for each post. The Private option hides the post from everyone except editors and administrators."

For example, you could have a <em>standard</em> blog post with a title and paragraphs, or a short <em>aside</em> that omits the title and contains a short text blurb. Please refer to the Codex for <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats#Supported_Formats">descriptions of each post format</a>. Your theme could enable all or some of 10 possible formats."
