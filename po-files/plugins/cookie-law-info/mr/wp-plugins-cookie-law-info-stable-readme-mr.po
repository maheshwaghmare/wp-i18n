#. Short description.
msgid "A simple way to get GDPR Cookie Consent as per EU GDPR/Cookie Law regulations. Style it to match your own website."
msgstr ""

#. Plugin name.
msgid "GDPR Cookie Consent"
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "But if another plugin adds scripts or places a cookie then we do not have any control. We have no way of knowing what plugins you use or how they work, so blocking/deleting cookies on a WordPress website/blog would possibly/probably break your site. Larger websites with huge budgets may well invest in such technology, but this plugin aims to help you provide a certain level of compliance without taking drastic action."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "We provide you the facility to add cookies and the corresponding scripts (This works if the cookies are placed when a script is added to the site header or footer as in the case of Google analytics, Hotjar etc..). In our premium version, visitors can reject the category of cookies they don't want to get installed. In such cases all cookies in that category will be blocked for the user. In the free version you can still block the scripts but doesn't have category level granularity."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "No. Only the 'necessary' cookies will be loaded till the user gives consent."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid ""
"No. This plugin restricts cookies by optionally loading the scripts. For this you have to add all cookies using the add cookie feature. It is not currently technically possible to completely block all cookies on your WordPress website without first updating all plugins that use cookies in some way. That is beyond the scope of any single plugin.\n"
"A more realistic approach for WordPress website owners is to move the scripts that place cookies( for eg Google Analytics tracking code) to the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin and then allow visitors to control it by giving consent."

"No.\n"
"As a generic plugin there's no way we can know anything about your specific circumstances. It can be used as part of an overall plan of action to comply, but just installing it and doing nothing more does nothing to help you. In all cases, you need to assess your own website's use of cookies and decide an appropriate course of action. If you are looking for specialist legal advice relating to your website you should always consult a lawyer.\n"
