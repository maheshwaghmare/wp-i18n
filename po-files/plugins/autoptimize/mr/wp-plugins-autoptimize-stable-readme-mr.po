#. Short description.
msgid "Autoptimize speeds up your website by optimizing JS, CSS, images (incl. lazy-load), HTML and Google Fonts, asyncing JS, removing emoji cruft and more."

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "The short answer: probably not. Although inlining all CSS will make the CSS non-render blocking, it will result in your base HTML-page getting significantly bigger thus requiring more \"roundtrip times\". Moreover when considering multiple pages being requested in a browsing session the inline CSS is sent over each time, whereas when not inlined it would be served from cache."

msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "When clearing AO's cache, no page cache should contain pages (HTML) that refers to the removed optimized CSS/ JS. Although for that purpose there is integretion between Autoptimize and some page caches, this integration does not cover 100% of setups so you might need to purge your page cache manually."

msgid "In case your blog looks weird, i.e. when the layout gets messed up, there is problem with CSS optimization. Try excluding one or more CSS-files from being optimized. You can also force CSS not to be aggregated by wrapping it in noptimize-tags in your theme or widget or by adding filename (for external stylesheets) or string (for inline styles) to the exclude-list."

msgid "Autoptimize makes optimizing your site really easy. It can aggregate, minify and cache scripts and styles, injects CSS in the page head by default but can also inline critical CSS and defer the aggregated full CSS, moves and defers scripts to the footer and minifies HTML. You can optimize (and even convert to WebP) and lazy-load images, optimize Google Fonts, async non-aggregated JavaScript, remove WordPress core emoji cruft and more. As such it can improve your site's performance even when already on HTTP/2! There is extensive API available to enable you to tailor Autoptimize to each and every site's specific needs."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "JavaScript files that are not autoptimized (because they were excluded or because they are hosted elsewhere) are typically render-blocking. By adding them in the comma-separated \"async JS\" field, Autoptimize will add the async flag causing the browser to load those files asynchronously (i.e. non-render blocking). This can however break your site (page), e.g. if you async \"js/jquery/jquery.js\" you will very likely get \"jQuery is not defined\"-errors. Use with care."

msgid "Preconnect is a somewhat advanced feature to instruct browsers (<a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preconnect\">if they support it</a>) to make a connection to specific domains even if the connection is not immediately needed. This can be used e.g. to lessen the impact of 3rd party resources on HTTPS (as DNS-request, TCP-connection and SSL/TLS negotiation are executed early). Use with care, as preconnecting to too many domains can be counter-productive."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Google Fonts are typically loaded by a \"render blocking\" linked CSS-file. If you have a theme and plugins that use Google Fonts, you might end up with multiple such CSS-files. Autoptimize (since version 2.3) now let's you lessen the impact of Google Fonts by either removing them alltogether or by optimizing the way they are loaded. There are two optimization-flavors; the first one is \"combine and link\", which replaces all requests for Google Fonts into one request, which will still be render-blocking but will allow the fonts to be loaded immediately (meaning you won't see fonts change while the page is loading). The alternative is \"combine and load async\" which uses JavaScript to load the fonts in a non-render blocking manner but which might cause a \"flash of unstyled text\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Although some online performance assessement tools will single out \"query strings for static files\" as an issue for performance, in general the impact of these is almost non-existant. As such Autoptimize, since version 2.3, allows you to have the query string (or more precisely the \"ver\"-parameter) removed, but ticking \"remove query strings from static resources\" will have little or no impact of on your site's performance as measured in (milli-)seconds."

As such Autoptimize will allow you to improve your performance (load time measured in seconds) and will probably also help you tackle some specific Pagespeed warnings. If you want to improve further, you will probably also have to look into e.g. page caching and your webserver configuration, which will improve real performance (again, load time as measured by e.g. https://webpagetest.org) and your \"performance best practise\" pagespeed ratings."

The conclusion; configure, test, reconfigure, retest, tweak and look what works best in your context. Maybe it's just HTTP/2, maybe it's HTTP/2 + aggregation and minification, maybe it's HTTP/2 + minification (which AO can do as well, simply untick the \"aggregate JS-files\" and/ or \"aggregate CSS-files\" options).
