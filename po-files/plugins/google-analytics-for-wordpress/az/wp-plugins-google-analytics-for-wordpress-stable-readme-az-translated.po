#. Found in changelog list item.
msgid "New: We now output a notice in the console and output the GA code (though do not run it) when we're not tracking someone. This makes it easier to verify the Google code is indeed outputting, and also makes it more clear as to why a particular user isn't being tracked. Note, when testing Google Analytics code, always do it logged out, ideally in the private browsing/incognito mode of your web browser. We're going to keep working on improving the frontend system to simplify it and add new features for both Lite and Pro users now that we've jettisoned ga.js support in MonsterInsights 7.0. You'll see updates through the year that add new tracking features, particularly ones that we're tweaking in order to expand and refine our built-in reporting."

msgstr ""

#. Found in changelog list item.
msgid "Removed: Many deprecated filters from the Yoast era have been removed. After maintaining backwards compatibility for over a year now, and also issuing a notice every time those deprecated filters were used, it's time to pull the plug on these to allow our tracking system to be able to be simplified in the future. We have a complete document in our documentation for the 6.0 release that details exactly how to update for each of these filters."
msgstr ""

#. Found in changelog list item.
msgid "Removed: Support for the long deprecated PHP events tracking has been removed. We've had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now offering a 1 click update. The PHP events tracking, a stayover from the Yoast years, caused a lot of issues and couldn't track everything on a page. It could only track things in specific WordPress areas like the_content and widgets, but couldn't track anything outside of that, or things that were added to the DOM after WordPress rendered the page. Our JS events tracking system can track all-the-things on all parts of a page, and is far more accurate and easier for us to maintain. Maintaining a gigantic PHP regex-based system took a lot of our development time up, and based on our opt-in tracking data, almost no one uses it anymore (which is good, because JS tracking is so much better). Users still using it will be automatically switched to JS events tracking on update (which requires no changes to switch to using it)."
msgstr ""

#. Found in changelog list item.
msgid "Removed: Support for the long deprecated ga.js tracking has been removed. We've had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now, and it's time to remove support for these finally. Analytics.js tracking is far more accurate than ga.js tracking. Users of ga.js were not able to take advantage of new MonsterInsights features and Google Analytics features that relied on analytics.js, including our out-of-the-box Javascript based events tracking system, and many other features (like enhanced eCommerce tracking in our eCommerce addon). Google themselves deprecated ga.js over 5 years ago. On update, we'll automatically move those using ga.js to analytics.js. This switch requires no changes on behalf of the site owner."

#. Found in changelog list item.
msgid "Tweak: When first adding a license key, in rare cases sometimes the addons permissions didn't sync. While extremely rare, and while MonsterInsights would automatically fix itself within 6 hours, we've added a system that eliminates this from happening, and made sure that there's also a way to fix this manually if this need arises."
