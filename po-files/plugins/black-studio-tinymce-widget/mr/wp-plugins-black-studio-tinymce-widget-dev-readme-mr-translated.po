"<a href=\"https://wpml.org\">WPML</a> is the leading commercial plugin for WordPress multi-language sites.\n"
"If you're using WPML v3.8 or newer and you need to translate a widget, we recommend to create a separate widget for each language of your site and assign the language to each widget accordingly using the selector \"Display on language\" provided by WPML. This way you will be able to work with the visual editor also for translations.\n"
"For older versions of WPML (up to 3.7.x), we recommend to install the 3rd party <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpml-widgets/\">WPML Widgets</a> plugin, which provides the same feature described above, that was not available natively on WPML. In the past, we also suggested to translate the widgets using the official WPML String Translation plugin, but this method is now deprecated as it was not very friendly due to the inability of using the visual editor for translations. If you were using WPML String Translation, we recommend to switch to the aforementioned translation method and remove the entries in WPML String Translation list after you moved them to be real widgets. Starting from version 2.6.0 of Black Studio TinyMCE Widget, a warning will be displayed if any deprecated translation is detected."

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "This plugin adds a new <code>Visual Editor</code> widget type that allows you to insert rich text and media objects in your sidebars with no hassle. With Black Studio TinyMCE Widget you will be able to edit your widgets in a WYSIWYG manner using the native WordPress TinyMCE editor, just like you do in posts and pages. And if you are a developer you may still switch back and forth from Visual to HTML mode. For years the default WordPress text widget lacked functionalities and it required HTML knowledge, this plugin was born to overcome these limitations. The recent releases of WordPress (starting from version 4.8 released in June 2017), finally included a native visual text widget, but it's pretty minimal and it doesn't provide all the features available with Black Studio TinyMCE Widget, which still remains a must-have for advanced users."

You may find references to the old name in articles and videos on the web, so don't panic if you don't see the <code>Black Studio TinyMCE Widget</code> in your available widgets, just look for <code>Visual Editor</code>.
