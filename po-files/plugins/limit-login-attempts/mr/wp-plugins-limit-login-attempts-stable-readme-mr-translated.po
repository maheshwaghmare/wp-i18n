msgid "If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table. In a default setup this would work: \"UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '' WHERE option_name = 'limit_login_lockouts'\""

msgid "A reverse proxy is a server in between the site and the Internet (perhaps handling caching or load-balancing). This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated."

#. Found in changelog paragraph.
msgid "In theory the \"auth cookie\" is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts."

msgid "Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all \"auth cookie\" attempts would keep getting logged."
