msgid "When WordPress uses a particular transient, that specific transient is re-created automatically. So, it's normaly for ones which are in active use to gradually re-appear. The best way to keep things optimal is to clear the transient options on a scheduled basis. For example, WordPress may create 50 transient option in a week. If you schedule WP-Optimize to clear these options on a weekly basis, you’ll have far fewer building up."

However, the savings and speed-ups can be substantial; it is always worth making sure that your database is optimized."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Yes; optimizing does not involve any \"tricks\" or poking around in dangerous ways. It involves running routine clean-up operations using well-defined, common MySQL commands.

msgid "<strong>Make space:</strong> When you edit a post or page on your website, WordPress automatically saves the new revision to the database. If you edit things a few times (and particularly if the post is long), your database soon gets clogged up with old revisions that just sit there, taking up valuable space. WP-Optimize removes these unnecessary post revisions, freeing up valuable Megabytes of data and increasing speed and efficiency.
