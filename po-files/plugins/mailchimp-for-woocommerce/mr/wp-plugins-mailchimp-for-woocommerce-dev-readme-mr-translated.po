"The Mailchimp for WooCommerce supports Wordpress Multi Sites and below are a few things to note.\n"
"- Each site that has the plugin installed is a separate connection to Mailchimp.\n"
"- Deactivating - disables the plugin from sending data to Mailchimp. Upon reactivating the plugins original setup details will be intact. Deleting is necessary to connect a different Mailchimp Audience with WooCommerce.\n"
"- Deleting removes the connection between Mailchimp and WooCommerce, and uninstalls the plugin from your site.\n"
