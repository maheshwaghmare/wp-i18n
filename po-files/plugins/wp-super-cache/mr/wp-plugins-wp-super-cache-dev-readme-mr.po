"The cookies WP Super Cache uses to identify \"known users\" can be modified now by adding the names of those cookies to a list in the plugin configuration. Use wpsc_add_cookie( $name ) to add a new cookie, and wpsc_delete_cookie( $name ) to remove it. The cookie names also modify the mod_rewrite rules used by the plugin but I recommend using Simple mode caching to avoid complications with updating the .htaccess file.\n"
"The cookie name and value are used to differenciate users so you can have one cookie, but different values for each type of user on your site for example. They'll be served different cache files."

msgid "WP Super Cache has it's own plugin system. This code is loaded when WP Super Cache loads and can be used to change how caching is done. This is before most of WordPress loads so some functionality will not be available. Plugins can be located anywhere that PHP can load them. Add your own plugin by calling wpsc_add_plugin( $name ) where $name is the full filename and path to the plugin. You only need to call that function once to add it. Use wpsc_delete_plugin( $name ) to remove it from the list of loaded plugins."

msgid "WordPress deletes the plugin folder when it updates a plugin. This is the same with WP Super Cache so any modified files in wp-super-cache/plugins/ will be deleted. You can put your custom plugins in a different directory in a number of ways. You can define the variable $wp_cache_plugins_dir in wp-config.php or wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and point it at a directory outside of the wp-super-cache folder. The plugin will look there for it's plugins. Or if you distribute a plugin that needs to load early you can use the function <code>wpsc_add_plugin( $filename )</code> to add a new plugin wherever it may be. Use <code>wpsc_delete_plugin( $filename )</code> to remove the plugin file.

"Your cache directory fills up over time, which takes up space on your server. If space is limited or billed by capacity, or if you worry that the cached pages of your site will go stale then garbage collection has to be done. Garbage collection happens on a regular basis and deletes old files in the cache directory. On the advanced settings page you can specify:\n"
"1. Cache timeout. How long cache files are considered fresh for. After this time they are stale and can be deleted.\n"
"2. Scheduler. Setup how often garbage collection should be done.\n"
"3. Notification emails. You can be informed on garbage collection job progress.\n"
"There's no right or wrong settings for garbage collection. It depends on your own site.\n"
"If your site gets regular updates, or comments then set the timeout to 1800 seconds, and set the timer to 600 seconds.\n"

Preloading will visit each page of your site generating a cached page as it goes along, just like any other visitor to the site. Due to the sequential nature of this function, it can take some time to preload a complete site if there are many posts.\n"
"To make preloading more effective it can be useful to disable garbage collection so that older cache files are not deleted. This is done by enabling \"Preload Mode\" in the settings. Be aware however, that pages will go out of date eventually but that updates by submitting comments or editing posts will clear portions of the cache."
