msgid "With the release of RegistrationMagic 4, Login Logout system has been substantially revamped. While login has always been an integral part of RegistrationMagic, it wasn’t as feature rich as the registration part. But now, with its own central management area, The Login Form Dashboard, it is much more capable and scalable system. You can now edit both Username and Password fields including custom errors and labels. You get a multi-level login validation process that uses reCAPTCHA, IP Filters (Premium) and Two-Factor Authentication (Premium). As with other forms, you can tweak visual elements of the login form. We have included four new custom email templates attached to login events. We have further introduced a new, multipurpose Login Logout button Widget. It renders Login Logout buttons based on user login state, displays login form as a pop-up or page, and information about the user on hover. We have moved all external integration services specific to login under a single section and added Login Analytics with user login timeline under it. Login Timeline also features advance filtering. A new Login tab now appears on user pages inside User Manager, with a chronological list of login events specific to the user."

It combines the role of both powerful login and registration plugin."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "The user area also has many productivity features. For example, users can check status of their submissions, download filled forms as PDFs, find all emails sent by you in a single place, etc. all from a single user area published using a single shortcode. In fact, the user area is built in such a way that it fits inside any WordPress theme you are using, by automatically picking theme's accent colors. One thing less to worry about!"

msgid "Customer journey on your site starts with the sign-up process. There are multiple configuration settings in RegistrationMagic to curate sign-up experience for your users. These include different types of limits along with granular access controls, offering them to select user roles, display and hide signup form fields using preset conditions, etc. You also have complete control over redirections after sign-up, sending users email updates and even add automation to take care of recurring tasks. Signup form can be styled using the Visual Design Editor in the form dashboard allowing you to match it with your theme and branding."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "That being said, RegistrationMagic is an equally powerful contact form system. Intelligent contact forms are one of its many unique features build upon real world case scenarios. Since registration and contact forms are neatly displayed inside a single All Forms section, you get a single place to manage all your user submissions and workflows."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Another example would be to use it as WordPress course registration plugin. The Custom Status system allows combining multiple actions in a single click. (Just like your very own macros!) This enables you to move submissions through a vetting process. Every action can prompt user to fulfill certain requirements. With advance Inbox filters and saved searches, It's a cinch to sort and mark submissions. Failed registration attempts can be routed through different registration setup."

msgid "With RegistrationMagic you can build anything from simple to complex registration approval system. Powerful Custom Status offers an option to create multi-step registration approval process. Automations can be used too for automated registration approval mechanism. These features allow you to use RegistrationMagic for industry specific registration systems. For example, a WordPress event registration form. If you are registering with limited seats, the Limits feature can help you build WordPress event registration form which has both a booking time window and option to limit the no of bookings. You can also generate token numbers for every booking for such event registration forms."

msgid "Running a WooCommerce store? WooCommerce user registration is another area where RegistrationMagic comes in handy. We understand, limited registration options in WooCommerce can tie you down.

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "Not happy with default wordpress registration page? You can define and replace default WordPress registration page with your own custom-built form. RegistrationMagic provides you with more control and flexibility over your WordPress registration page. It redefines what a login and registration plugin should be able to do. It combines standalone roles of both login and registration plugin."

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "In fact you can daisy chain multiple forms like this to create a system of forms! It opens up a host of new possibilities."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Ans: RegistrationMagic allows you to set limits to your forms and render a different form once the limit has reached. Limit can be based on number of form submissions or a set date. To create early bird form system, you need to create two different forms - One for Early Bird user registration and the other one for regular user registration. Obviously, you can set different prices for them. After that, set limit on the early bird form by going to Form Card → Settings → Limits. Turn on ‘Auto Expires’, then define its limits. Below the limits, there’s an option ‘Post Expiry Action’. Select Display another form. A new drop down will appear below it. Choose your regular user registration form. Now go ahead and publish your early bird form and RegistrationMagic will take care of the rest :)"

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Ans: RegistrationMagic uses standard WordPress po/mo files for maintaining translations. You can use any po editor to translate. We recommend Loco Translate, since it is a free Wordpress plugin and works directly from admin dashboard. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/\">Click here to get it</a>"
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Ans: You can easily do it from Form Settings → Design. Once inside, click on the animating circle on the submit button. A panel will show up where you can change the button label along with color and numerous other attributes."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Ans: This may happen if you are using a caching plugin. RegistrationMagic form is a dynamic entity and many features such as analytics may not work properly if the form is served from a cached copy. You will need to exclude the form page from caching inside your cache plugin’s configuration. After, that Purge the cache and try again."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Another reason can be minification of JS files and inline scripts. Disable these if you are using a plugin for minification and try again."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Ans: Most of the time this happens due to a javascript error from a third-party plugin or theme. You will need to check browser console and see if there are any errors pointing to a file outside of RegistrationMagic repository. If you are able to trace it to a plugin, try disabling it and reload the form."

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Also make sure that you are using latest version of RegistrationMagic, as this issue may arise from IPv6 connections, which were addressed in latest versions."

msgid "Note that in RegistrationMagic Premium, a global override is also available for this setting in Form Settings → Global Overrides."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Ans: This is an anti-spam measure built into RegistrationMagic. A form can be submitted only certain number of times from a given device within a period of 24 hours. You can define the limit from Global Settings → Security. Change the value of Form Submission Limit for a Device as required. Set the limit to zero in order to disable the feature altogether, i.e. allow unlimited submissions from a device."
