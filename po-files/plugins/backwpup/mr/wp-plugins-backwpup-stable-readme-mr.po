"* Your WordPress root directory or backup directory requires authentication. Set username and password in Settings-&gt;Network.\n"

"BackWPup uses WordPress’ own cron job system (<strong>WP Cron</strong>) to execute scheduled backup jobs. In order for WordPress to “know” when to execute a job, its “inner clock” needs to be set regularly. That happens whenever someone (including yourself) visits your site.\n"
"If your site happens to not being visited for a period of time, WordPress’ inner clock gets sort of slow. In that case it takes an extra server-side cron job to regularly call http://your-site.tld/wp-cron.php and tell WordPress what time it is."
